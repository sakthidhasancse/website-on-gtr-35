ABSTRACT:
         LEGENDARY isn’t found in a lap time. Or a 0-100 number. Or even on a price tag.It’s built on an obsession to detail. And a radical belief that a real supercar delivers performance in real-world conditions. For anyone. Anywhere. Anytime. So refined, yet so capable, in the right hands it can turn the automotive world on its ear.The new Nissan GT-R. Its history speaks of world-beating performance, but the pursuit will always be of pure EXHILARATION. It’s a supercar that takes your breath away – even when sitting still.
         From a tradition of craftsmanship comes the GT-R’s dashboard, made from a single Nappa leather hide, hand-selected for tone and free of the slightest imperfection. Gently folded, the piece requires less padding, which improves your view, saves weight and creates a stunning work of art. You see a 2017 GT-R. With an undeniable presence and stance. But to the air, it looks like a low-slung, mid-engine exotic with barely room for two, let alone four. The Nissan GT-R team spent two years at the Lotus Group’s rolling road wind tunnel in Europe and 1.5 in Yoshitaka Suzuka in Japan to bring the secrets of supercar aerodynamics to the street. So in this website we have presented all the information about the GTR-35.
